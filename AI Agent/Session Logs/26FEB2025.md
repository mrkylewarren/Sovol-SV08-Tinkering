# Detailed Log of Sovol SV08 Troubleshooting Session — February 26, 2025

This log documents a troubleshooting session focused on integrating an Eddy USB probe into a Sovol SV08 3D printer running Klipper firmware. The primary goal was to enhance the `START_PRINT` macro by incorporating an Eddy rapid mesh scan.

---

## Initial Goal
- **Objective**: Modify the `START_PRINT` macro to include an Eddy rapid mesh scan (`BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan`) after the heat soak and quad gantry leveling (QGL), replacing the stock process.
- **Desired Workflow**: 
  1. Home all axes (X, Y, Z).
  2. Perform heat soaking and QGL.
  3. Execute the Eddy rapid scan.
  4. Finalize heating and start printing with a clean first layer.
- **Success Criterion**: A test print with an “excellent” first layer, validated by user feedback.

## Issue 1: Recursive `G28` Errors During Homing
- **Problem Description**: Initiating homing with `G28` caused the printer to enter a recursive loop, repeatedly calling the homing macro and failing to complete the process. The printer halted with errors.
- **Observed Behavior**: Console logs showed multiple `G28` calls stacking without resolution.
- **Root Cause**: The `[homing_override]` macro in `eddy.cfg` contained `G28 Y`, `G28 X`, and `G28 Z` commands, which conflicted with an overridden `G28` definition in `printer.cfg`. This created a recursive loop.
- **Final Solution**: Modified `[homing_override]` to use non-recursive homing commands:
  ```ini
  [homing_override]
  gcode:
      G28.1 Y  ; Home Y without recursion
      G28.1 X  ; Home X without recursion
      G28.1 Z  ; Home Z without recursion
  ```
  The `G28.1` command directly invokes the low-level homing routine, bypassing the overridden `G28` macro.

Outcome: Homing completed successfully for all axes without recursion errors, as verified by a clean `G28` execution in the console.

## Issue 2: "Probe Triggered Prior to Movement" During Z Homing
- **Problem Description**: During Z-axis homing, the Eddy probe triggered before any downward movement, resulting in an immediate error: "Probe triggered prior to movement."
- **Observed Behavior**: The Z-axis halted at its starting position, and the probe’s LED indicated activation due to proximity to the bed.
- **Root Cause**: The Z-axis was initialized too close to the bed, causing the Eddy probe to detect the surface before the homing descent began.
- **Final Solution**: Added a guaranteed Z lift at the start of `[homing_override]`:
  ```ini
  [homing_override]
  gcode:
      G91          ; Switch to relative positioning
      G0 Z5 F1000  ; Lift Z by 5mm at 1000mm/min
      G90          ; Return to absolute positioning
      G28.1 Y
      G28.1 X
      G28.1 Z
  ```
  This ensured the nozzle started at a safe height above the bed before Z homing commenced.

Outcome: Z homing executed without premature probe triggers, allowing the Eddy probe to descend and measure correctly.

## Issue 3: "Must Home Axis First" Error During XY Movement
- **Problem Description**: After homing X and Y, an attempt to move the toolhead to the bed center (e.g., `G1 X177.5 Y177.5`) for Z homing triggered a "Must home axis first" error.
- **Observed Behavior**: The printer rejected the XY movement command, indicating that not all axes were in a homed state.
- **Root Cause**: The homing sequence moved XY before Z was homed, violating Klipper’s requirement that all axes be homed prior to unrestricted movement.
- **Solution**: Reordered the `[homing_override]` macro to home Z immediately after X and Y, before any XY positioning:
  ```ini
  [homing_override]
  gcode:
      G91
      G0 Z5 F1000
      G90
      G28.1 Y
      G28.1 X
      G28.1 Z
      G1 X177.5 Y177.5 F5000  ; Move to bed center after all axes homed
  ```
Outcome: The toolhead moved to the bed center without errors, enabling Z homing to proceed from a consistent starting position.

## Issue 4: SET_Z_FROM_PROBE Macro Failure
- **Problem Description**: The `SET_Z_FROM_PROBE` macro, called during Z homing, failed with an error indicating an undefined reference to `safe_z_home`.
- **Observed Behavior**: Execution halted mid-homing, with the console reporting a missing variable or section.
- **Root Cause**: The macro referenced `safe_z_home.z_hop`, but the `[safe_z_home]` section was commented out in both `printer.cfg` and `eddy.cfg`, leaving the variable undefined.
- **Solution**: Replaced the problematic reference with a hardcoded Z lift command in `SET_Z_FROM_PROBE`:
  ```ini
  [set_z_from_probe]
  gcode:
      G1 Z10 F1000  ; Lift nozzle to 10mm after probing
  ```
Outcome: The macro executed successfully, lifting the nozzle to Z=10 post-probe without errors.

## Step 5: Integrating Eddy Rapid Scan into START_PRINT
- **Objective**: Incorporate the Eddy rapid scan into `START_PRINT` after heat soaking and QGL, ensuring a fresh bed mesh before each print.
- **Implementation**: Updated the `START_PRINT` macro with the rapid scan command:
  ```ini
  [gcode_macro START_PRINT]
  gcode:
      G28                     ; Home all axes using homing_override
      ; Heat soak and QGL steps (pre-existing)
      BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan  ; Perform Eddy rapid scan
      ; Final heating and print start (added later)
  ```
Outcome: The rapid scan executed successfully, with console output confirming completion:
```
9:43 PM
Beginning rapid surface scan at height 2.00...
9:43 PM
Mesh Bed Leveling Complete
```

## Step 6: Restoring the Purge Sequence to START_PRINT
- **Problem Description**: The stock firmware’s purge blob and wipe line were absent from the Klipper `START_PRINT` macro.
- **Solution**: Appended a purge sequence to `START_PRINT`:
  ```ini
  [gcode_macro START_PRINT]
  gcode:
      G28
      ; Heat soak, QGL, and rapid scan (from prior steps)
      ; Final heating...
      G90                    ; Absolute positioning
      G1 X10 Y10 Z0.3 F5000  ; Move to purge position
      G92 E0                 ; Reset extruder
      G1 E10 F200            ; Extrude 10mm for purge blob
      G1 X100 Y10 Z0.3 F1500 E15  ; Wipe with a purge line
      G92 E0                 ; Reset extruder again
  ```
Outcome: The nozzle was primed with a purge blob and wipe line, ensuring a clean start.

## Final Outcome
Successful Print: A test print using the updated `START_PRINT` macro resulted in an “excellent” first layer, as reported by the user.
