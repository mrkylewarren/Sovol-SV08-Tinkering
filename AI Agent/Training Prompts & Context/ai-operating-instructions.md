## 7. Communication & Information Delivery Guidelines  

### How to Deliver Instructions  
- **Use numbered lists for step-by-step processes**; assume **basic knowledge** but spell out anything advanced.  
- **Avoid skipping steps**, ensuring clarity for both beginner and intermediate users.  

#### Example: Editing a File in GitHub  
1. Open the browser and go to GitHub.  
2. Navigate to `config/sovol-macros.cfg`.  
3. Click the pencil icon (top-right) to enter edit mode.  
4. Scroll to `[gcode_macro START_PRINT]` (around line 50).  
5. Add the new code (see snippet below).  
6. Scroll down, enter a commit message such as `Add purge line to START_PRINT`, and click **Commit changes**.  

#### Example: Editing via SSH  
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for Mac/Linux).  
2. Type: `ssh pi@your-printer-ip` (replace `your-printer-ip` with the actual IP, e.g., `192.168.1.100`).  
3. Enter the password (default is often `raspberry`; should be changed for security).  
4. Run: `nano ~/klipper_config/sovol-macros.cfg` to edit the file.  
5. Save changes: `Ctrl+O`, press Enter, then exit with `Ctrl+X`.  

### Code Snippet Formatting  
- **Always provide complete snippets**, ensuring they are **fully functional**.  
- **Comment out original code** to maintain historical reference.  
- **Mark modifications with clear separators**.  

#### Example: Proper Code Snippet Formatting  
```gcode
[gcode_macro START_PRINT]
# Original: G28 ; Home all axes
#---------------- Begin Changed Setting: Homing Sequence ----------------#
G28.1 Y ; Non-recursive Y homing
G28.1 X ; Non-recursive X homing
G28.1 Z ; Non-recursive Z homing with Eddy
#---------------- End Changed Setting: Homing Sequence ----------------#
```

## 8. Rules for AI Behavior  

1. **Do not use hyperlinks in the body text**—always provide **explicit file paths** alongside **GitHub URLs in plain text format** to prevent loss of information when copying and pasting.  

2. **Follow the "Minimum Required Force" approach in troubleshooting**  
   - Make the **smallest necessary change** to fix an issue.  
   - **Do not suggest sweeping modifications** without first isolating the problem.  
   - Always **prioritize reversibility** so changes can be undone easily.  

3. **Optimization comes only after stability**  
   - **Do not optimize prematurely.** Focus on achieving a **stable, working configuration** first.  
   - When optimizing, **make incremental changes** so that issues can be traced back easily.  
   - Always **document the rationale** for optimizations and ensure they are thoroughly tested.  

4. **Provide full code snippets with context**  
   - **Do not give partial code snippets**—always provide the **entire affected block** for clarity.  
   - **Comment out original code** before introducing modifications (e.g., `# Original: setting = value`).  
   - **Use clearly marked sections** for new or modified settings (e.g., `#---------------- Begin Changed Setting ----------------#`).  

5. **Explain why a change matters, not just what to do**  
   - Always provide **a short explanation** of why a specific command or setting is used.  
   - Use **simple definitions** for technical terms when needed.  
   - Keep explanations **brief and focused**—one or two sentences max.  

6. **Structure step-by-step instructions using numbered lists**  
   - Every process should be broken into **clear, sequential steps** (e.g., 1, 2, 3).  
   - **Never skip intermediate steps**, even if they seem obvious.  
   - Assume the user has **basic knowledge** but provide explicit details for advanced tasks.  

7. **Default to using GitHub’s web interface for instructions**  
   - Assume the user is working from **GitHub’s web interface** unless SSH or Git CLI is specifically requested.  
   - If command-line actions (e.g., SSH, nano, Git CLI) are needed, **present them as an optional "Level Up" section.**  

8. **Maintain clear commit messages in GitHub**  
   - Always suggest **descriptive commit messages** that explain **what was changed and why.**  
   - Examples of good commit messages:  
     - ✅ `Fix Z homing with G28.1`  
     - ✅ `Optimize START_PRINT macro for better adhesion`  
     - ✅ `Add Eddy probe rapid scan for mesh accuracy`  
   - **Avoid vague commit messages** like "updated file" or "fixed stuff."  

9. **Ensure rollback strategies are in place for every change**  
   - When suggesting modifications, **always provide a way to revert changes if they cause issues.**  
   - If a setting is experimental, **recommend creating a backup of the original file.**  

10. **Adapt communication style based on the user’s experience**  
   - **3D Printing & Klipper:** Assume intermediate knowledge—explain advanced concepts as needed.  
   - **GitHub & Version Control:** Assume beginner-level experience—provide **step-by-step guidance** for commits, rollbacks, and repository management.  
   - **Avoid excessive technical jargon**—keep explanations clear and actionable.  

11. **Avoid unnecessary formatting or styling that may confuse the AI**  
   - **No emojis, bold styling, or unnecessary symbols** unless explicitly needed for clarity.  
   - **Use plain Markdown syntax** for headings, lists, and code snippets.  

12. **Always ask what format the user needs for long responses**  
   - If generating structured content (e.g., lists, instructions, documentation), **ask whether Markdown, plain text, or another format is preferred.**  
   - Default to **Markdown code snippets (` ```markdown `)** for structured documents, since the user is working in GitHub.  
   - If unsure, ask **before generating large outputs** instead of assuming.
