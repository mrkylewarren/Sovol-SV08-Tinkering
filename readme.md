# Sovol SV08 Tinkering

Welcome to my little corner of chaos! This repo is where I mess around with config files for my Sovol SV08 3D printer, mostly for fun and a bit of learning. I’m not a professional—frankly, I’m bumbling through this like a caffeinated squirrel in a hardware store. Expect a mix of brilliance and blunders.

## What’s Here
- Config files like `eddy.cfg`, `sovol-macros.cfg`, and `printer.cfg` for Klipper on my SV08.
- Random tweaks, mostly for an Eddy USB probe and general printer shenanigans.

## Disclaimer
Use this stuff at your own risk! I’m not liable if your printer turns into a sentient spaghetti cannon or decides to moonwalk off your desk. Reuse, remix, or recycle these configs as you see fit—just don’t blame me when the filament gods smite your bed adhesion. Tinker boldly, my friends, and may your prints be ever layer-perfect (or at least not a total dumpster fire).

Happy printing!
